## Wireless Adapter
2.4GHz all-mode (including monitor mode) USB wireless adapters, available in TP-Link and Alfa models. Very useful for WiFi
sniffing and injection activities.

## HackRF One
VHF/UHF Rx/Tx software defined radio. Subject to transmitter restrictions.

## RTL-SDR
Less versatile than the HackRF One, and only capable of receiving. Frequency range tops out at 2 GHz or less.

## Raspberry Pi 3
An inexpensive, portable computer running GNU+Linux. Useful for working with wireless equipment (e.g., the above) on-the-go.
