# Double Encrypted Puzzler
This puzzler contained a string that was encoded using
two different ciphers: a caesar cipher and a bacon cipher.

The first chunk of the string was a caesar cipher, which consists 
of shifting the letters in the sting down the alphabet by n 
letters, where n is they key, valued between 1 and 25.

The encrypted string starts with asky{, which we know needs to translate
to iasg{ because of how the flag is formatted. This can be achieved by shifting the letters 
in the string down the alphabet by 8 characters. Doing that gives us a new string: 
`iasg{I_hope_this_message_finds_you_well_I_never_thought_I'd_IIIIJIJIIIJIJIJIIJII_JIIJJIJJJI_IIIIJIIJIIIJIJJIJIJJ}` 

This works for the first half or so, but the second half still makes no sense. That's because the second half was
encoded separately using a bacon cipher. A bacon cipher is basically just binary, where AAAAA = a,
AAAAB= b, AAABA=c, and so on. Decrypting the second half of the string as A's and B's, not I's and J's, yeilds us:

`BIVE TO BELL}`

Which means we now have the complete flag.
