SQL Injection & ISELab
-------------------
This Tuesday we'll have Daniel Limanowski (president) presenting on SQL injection, which is a type of web application injection vulnerabilities. Injection is one of the
(OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilties)[https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project#OWASP_Top_10_for_2013].

IASG's new virtual environment IASG ISELab will be introduced at this meeting. Once everyone is ready to use it, we will walk through using SQL injection to attack a vulnerable
website in the ISELab environment!
