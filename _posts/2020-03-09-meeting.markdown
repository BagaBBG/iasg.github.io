AWS: Not Just for Silicon Valley Hype-Lords
-----------------------------
Tonight we will have a presentation from Logan Woolery on Hacking in AWS:

  Most people know AWS from it's major conferences, ubiquitous laptop sticker presence, 
  and annoying fanboys. However, if you scrape off some of the marketing buzzwords, it 
  starts to look like a hackers toolkit in the making. We will take a look at some of 
  the ways to use AWS to have fun. 

Afterwards we will have a beginners night from Joel Wacker on Radios: The Wild Wild West. The old, and the cool.
