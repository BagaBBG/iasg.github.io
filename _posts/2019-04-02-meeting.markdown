In Depth Red Team Debrief
-----------------------------
This Tuesday, we will have an in-depth red team debrief from members of ISEAGE staff on 
what steps blue teamers should've taken to secure their severs:

  ISEAGE rambles in an exhausted state about things that may have transpired at or
         around the CDC. Even if you did not compete in this CDC, much can be learned in terms of 
         identifying and fixing vulnerabilities.
