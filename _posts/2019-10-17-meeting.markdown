Red Team Debrief
-----------------------------
This Thursday we will have an in-depth red team debrief from members of ISEAGE:

    We will be presenting an extended red team debrief for the Fall 2019 ISU CDC. 
    This presentation will cover what holes the ISEAGE staff put into the scenario
    and explain how you might fix them. Even if you did not compete in this CDC, 
    much can be learned in terms of identifying and fixing vulnerabilities


Afterwards I will be giving a beginners night on Nmap, a powerful network scanner that
is almost always used in the early stages of a penetration test.
