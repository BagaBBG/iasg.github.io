  Tomorrow at IASG, Jake Drahos will be presenting on Reverse Engineering Web APIs: This talk will provide some background and an introduction to reverse engineer a private web API used by a mobile application. Many applications rely on an API, which is not exposed to the user. What happens when we start talking directly to this API?

Following the presentation, there will be a Lab Jam in Coover 1012 where you can go hands-on with these topics, and/or play with the IASG virtual environment.

Additionally, this Saturday is the National Cyber Defense Competition at Iowa State. For the first time ever, the CDC is augmented with a Cyber-Physical aspect, addressing security concerns with SCADA in addition to the web. ISEAGE is looking for Green Team volunteers to help out at the competition. You can sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ATftRcIRt7rQW_EFwc0sPnTZhsRp6q3k2Iqb6O0x9F8/viewform). 

If you are going, good luck at the career fair tomorrow!
