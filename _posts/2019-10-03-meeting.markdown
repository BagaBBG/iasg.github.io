Physical Security
-----------------------------
This Thursday, we will have a presentation Jack Potter on Physical Security:
      I'll be presenting some of my favorite physical security concepts and ideas, 
      as well as some case studies from my own experience carrying out physical
      penetration tests.


Afterwards we will have a Beginners Night on Blue Teaming by Kevin Davis. Want to 
participate in the Cyber Defense Competition but don't know where to start? Stick 
around for this beginners night to get an idea of what you should be doing to 
defend your network.
