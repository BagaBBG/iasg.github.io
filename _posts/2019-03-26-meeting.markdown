Embedded System Security
-----------------------------
This Tuesday we will have a presentation by William Rickert on embedded system security:

    This presentation is an overview of attack surfaces for embedded devices. I will be covering Bluetooth low energy, uart/jtag,
    and memory extraction. I will also be doing a short blurb about my plastic frog project.

 

After the presentation, we will have a Beginners Night on Bug Bounties by Nic Losby, giving an introduction to Bug Bounty 
programs and how to get started with them.
