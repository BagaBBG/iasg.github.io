Active Directory Hacking
-----------------------------
This Monday we will have a presentation with pizza from RSM on hacking Active Directory:

    RSM is presenting on Active Directory Attacks Part 1, walking through initial access 
    on a network using the most common paths to reach domain administrator. We will be doing
    a deep dive on every step, sometimes even including exact commands to be run on the slides.
