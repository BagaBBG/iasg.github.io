Physical security
-----------------------------
Tomorrow we will have a presentation from Jack Potter on physical security:

    The presentation is a rapid-fire overview of physical security concepts and tools, designed to give people a brief introduction
    to some of the cool ideas in the field. From opening locks without keys to bypassing them entirely, copying physical keys and
    electronic key cards alike, mitigating physical security threats and more, the talk is one long sampler platter of awesome 
    physical security information.


After the presentation, we will have a Beginners Night on Networking by Kevin Davis. He will be covering basic networking 
protocols and concepts, as well as going over Linux commands related to configuring and testing networks.
