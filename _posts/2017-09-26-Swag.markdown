IASG is Getting Swag
-------------------
Attention IASG! Important announcement! 
## **IASG is getting SWAG!**
Unfortunately, I'm not much of a graphic designer, so I need your help. Make a design, and send it to <woolery@iastate.edu>. In two weeks, the submissions will be put to a vote, and if your design is selected, get a copy of it for _FREE._ To view previous submissions, go [here](www.bit.ly/IASGSWAG). Feel free to redesign an existing idea, or come up with your own. We are primarily looking for T-shirts and stickers, but if something else is popular, we might make it happen. Good Luck!


###### Fine print: All designs must be approved by the university before we can print them. Official guidelines [here](bit.ly/2wjmPUx) , TL;DR version is use common sense.
