    Hack-the-box solutions, mobile security presentation, and a Beginner's Night

There are three items planned:

1) There will be a quick walkthrough/solution for last week's hack-the-box.

2) Kevin Davis, social/media chair, will be giving a talk on mobile security.
Here's a description of the talk:

> This talk will provide an introduction to mobile security. We will talk
about why security is different on mobile devices, what complications can
arise on mobile devices, and some past vulnerabilities and issues that have
been found/continue to be found. We will also discuss the future and what
it may hold related to mobile device security as well as ways that people
can stay safe on their mobile devices.

3) Following Kevin's talk, we will have a Beginner's Night. The Beginner's
Night will be presented by cabinet secretary Megan Miller and it will cover
malware and antivirus.
