Systems Reverse Engineering
---
> Ever wondered how a smart TV, wireless router, or other IoT device works? We
  have previously talked about reverse engineering (RE) binaries, but this talk
  will focus on approaches to RE a black box system. We'll also cover firmware
  RE and some other approaches.

Beginner's Night
--
There will be a Beginner's Night following the meeting, where we'll talk about
a common and nasty web application vulnerability: cross site scripting (XSS).
