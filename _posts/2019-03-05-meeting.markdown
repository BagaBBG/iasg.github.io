IBM
-----------------------------
This Tuesday we will have a presentation from employees at IBM on the use of open-source intelligence gathering:

We're a team of pentesters who spent a week around Christmas performing open-source intelligence gathering targeting an
executive in our company to see what information was available publicly. The goal was to apply threat modeling techniques to
a person and highlight areas of concern. In our presentation we'll focus on the information sources available in the deep web
beyond what a google search will show you, provide examples of the surprising types of information we were able to successfully
acquire through these sources, and speak a bit to how our team organized itself. We'll also provide some key tips around online 
safety and some limitations on just how secure and anonymous you actually are.

 

After the presentation we will have a beginners night on Reverse Engineering by Nic Losby, covering some simple tools you can
use to extract information from executable files.
