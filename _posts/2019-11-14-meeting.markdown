Intrusion Detection Systems
-----------------------------
This Thursday Kole Swesey will be giving a presentation on intrusion detection systems (IDSes):

    Knowing what attacks are hitting your servers is a critical aspect of information security. 
    This week I will be giving an overview of what IDSes are & what they can do, ways they could be
    evaded from an attacker's point of view, and explaining how they can be used in cyber defense competitions
