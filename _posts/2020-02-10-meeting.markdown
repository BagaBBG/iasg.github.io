Open Source Intelligence
-----------------------------
Tonight we will have a presentation from Jack Potter on Open Source Intelligence:

    Learn to leverage open-source intelligence (OSINT) to do everything from footprinting 
    a target without touching it before attacking to finding interesting files on the open web. 
    This talk will focus on Shodan and Google, and will also include some other useful sources
    of online open source intelligence.
