The Information Assurance Student Group (IASG)
at Iowa State University holds weekly meetings on information
security topics. These meetings consist of convention-style
presentations about various infosec-related topics including
hacking, exploits, recent vulnerabilities in the news,
webapp vulnerabilities, and general hacker subjects such as 
radio, operating systems, and networking.

We often feature guest speakers from the security field, as well
as offer introductory-level presentations for those interested in
security, but without an extensive background in designing
and building information systems.
