<body><h1>You should not have followed that QR link. Here's why:</h1>
<p>- <strong>Drive By Download Attack:</strong> QR Codes can lead to URLs that forceably (and without consent) download (malicious) software that could harm your device. This attack is mainly geared towards Android devices but can be executed across a wide span of operating systems and computers</p>
<p>- <strong>Phishing Attack:</strong> Our QR code could have led to a website with a login form, asking you to login using your IASTATE credentials. A malicious actor could easily harvest your credentials and spend all of your dining dollars...how would you eat?!</p>
<p>- <strong>Harmful Websites</strong> - Websites can be written with code to execute browser exploits - these exploits can turn cameras/microphones on, access browsing history, and even send emails on your behalf. </p>
<h2>Protect yourself from QR codes by using QR scanners that show you the url and never giving any information (ie., login) to any QR-linked page.</h2>
